## Warning

Using script executors may violate Roblox's Terms of Service. Use this software responsibly and at your own risk.

## Getting Started

1. Download the latest version from the releases section.  
2. Run the bootstrap to initialize the environment.  
3. The bootstrap will automatically load the executor..  
4. Inject your script into Roblox and run it.

## Bootstrap

A lightweight **bootstrap** is included with Xerthinium Executor.  
It automatically runs through the **Windows Command Prompt (CMD)** to set up and start the executor.  

When launched, it:
- Checks required files and dependencies  
- Initializes the environment  
- Starts the main executor automatically  

You’ll see its progress directly in a CMD window when running the tool — this is normal behavior.
